# FAQ

## Frequently Asked HVAC Questions

It’s our job to help shine a light on questions that you may have about heating and air conditioning.

What is “Freon” and Do I Need to Change Mine Out?

Freon is a common name for refrigerants used in A/C systems to remove heat and keep your space cool. Older systems, especially those installed before the 2010s, often use R22, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon invented in 1928. R22 circulates through the copper lines of your system and helps cool your home or office.

You generally do not need to replace the refrigerant in your system unless there’s a leak. However, R22 is now very limited and expensive due to EPA regulations that restricted its sale.

Modern systems no longer use R22. Up until recently, R410a was the standard, which is much safer for the environment. As of January 1st, 2025, R410a has been banned, and the newer refrigerant R454b is now used. R454b is more environmentally friendly and efficient, so if you’re installing a new system or replacing your refrigerant, your technician will use this.

What Is The Most Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning System?

According to leading research, American Standard Platinum series equipment has the fewest breakdowns over the past 15 years. Moreover, these systems are generally quite safe, quiet and environmentally friendly.

Is It Cheaper to Heat With Gas Or Electric?

While it may seem tempting to invest in an electric heating system, gas heating systems are far more affordable. This is because electricity is more expensive per unit than natural gas. Over a lifetime, homeowners will spend thousands of dollars more on electricity than on gas.

What Size System Do I Need For My House?

That depends on a lot of little things that add up to a large picture. The old school way of doing it was roughly 400-500 square feet per ton. This is no longer used due to houses being built much tighter and with better code enforcements. Best thing to do is to get a Heat Load done on your home to know exactly what your home needs.
